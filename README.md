# ScottlandYardGame
A recreation of the Scot Land Yard Board Game in mostly PHP

// READ ME:
//Index file-- create Players, and call new Game
//Game file-- Game state/loop (eventually), Player creation
//Abstract_Character-- Parent Class for player and mrx
//player-- User character
//mrx-- NPC character
//map-generator file-- Stuff I found (didn't write) thought it might be useful if we
//wanted to go procedural generation route. We *could* create one giant table like that
//filled with map-tile objects.
